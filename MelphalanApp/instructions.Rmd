## How this application works

This application takes individual patient information such as; age, weight, height, serum creatinine, haematocrit, baseline absolute neutrophil count (ANC), gender, race/ethnicity and genetic information, to predict the most likely ANC time-profile following the administration of melphalan for a given dose using an underlying population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) model describing the time-dependent relationship between melphalan and ANC.

The *intent* is to identify a melphalan dose and time for granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF; Neupogen) administration that minimises the time the patient is likely to spend in Grade 4 Neutropenia (0.5 K/ÂµL).

Uncertainty in the model's prediction for the patient is graphically represented by 95% prediction intervals (2.5^th and 97.5^th percentiles), and can be used to guide dosing decisions.

**Note:** This application assumes no previous/recent melphalan dosing and therefore, does not required measured melphalan concentrations.

Melphalan concentrations and ANC are simulated using the *mrgsolve* package for the R statistical and programming language.
